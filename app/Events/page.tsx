    description: `This Workshop offers participants a thorough understanding of Linux operating systems, basic
command-line usage, networking essentials encompassing TCP/IP, subnetting, and routing, as
well as practical networking commands. Participants engage with live booting, virtualization
using VMware, and gain exposure to Wireshark for network traffic analysis. The workshop also
introduces Nmap for network scanning. Overall, attendees emerge equipped with fundamental
knowledge of Linux, networking concepts, and essential cybersecurity tools, priming them for
further exploration in these domains.`,
